## Why is DataMiner Support unique from the rest?

DataMiner Support Services doesnâ€™t just cover the traditional technical support. It is effectively a premium service, which is not to be compared with other offerings for similarly referenced services from other vendors (and definitely of course not to be compared with support services on device firmware). DataMiner Support is a risk-free and all-inclusive service, providing very tangible added value over time. The service includes:

### Updates & Upgrades: 

Through a cloud connected DataMiner System, you can self-download and install all minor updates (bug fixes and small enhancements) and all major upgrades (introducing important new features and capabilities) of both the DataMiner core software platform, and all the DataMiner Connectors that interface your DataMiner System with the various products within your operational ecosystem. In that context, it is worth pointing out the following:

- As opposed to many other software support services which only include bug fix-type of updates (i.e. major new upgrades with new functionality require the separate purchase of an upgrade license), DataMiner Support Services includes minor updates and as well as major upgrades of all deployed software components. This represents a considerable value, and DataMiner is renowned for adding significant new high-value functionality with those major upgrades. For example, in recent years we have delivered a very comprehensive new Dashboard module, we have transitioned DataMiner from SQL data storage to Cassandra & OpenSearch big data solutions, we have introduced (and we are continuously adding) quite sophisticated AI capabilities (e.g. forecasting, anomaly detection, pattern matching, alarm grouping, etc.) and these are just a few of those major upgrades we have been releasing.  We have also introduced dataminer.services feature with real-time live dashboard sharing, Ms teams chatbot integration, low-code/no-code apps and so on as well. In other words, the DataMiner Support service is a premium all-inclusive care-free service with substantial added value, as opposed to the typical status-quo / maintenance type of service offered by most software vendors.

- Noteworthy is also that the update & upgrade policy not only applies to the standard off-the-shelf core DataMiner platform, but also all the DataMiner Connectors deployed to interface your DataMiner platform with the wide variety of products deployed within your operational ecosystem.  In other words, the DataMiner Support service provides a risk-free all-inclusive guarantee of integration with your entire operational ecosystem at all times, irrespective of the number of changes and evolutions on the APIs of all your underlying off-the-shelf elements, and the nature of those. This component of the DataMiner Support Service is comparable to a flat fee insurance, where Skyline assumes the full risk towards the unknown factor of API evolutions on the many third party elements, resulting in a transparent and predictable cost-management for you.

### Technical Support

- The service also includes professional technical support for your complete setup, again a risk-free service at a fixed cost. In addition to that, note also that while the DataMiner core software platform is a standard off-the-shelf industry-standard proven software platform, every individual deployment of DataMiner system is still unique by itself. This results directly from the fact that every ecosystem is a unique environment by itself, and DataMiner is tightly integrated with that specific ecosystem end-to-end. This translates in an abundance of touchpoints between DataMiner and that specific ecosystem, based on a wide variety of different types of APIs. Furthermore, each individual ecosystem represent unique workflows and particular ways of working, resulting in a very unique set-up, leveraging the extensive DataMiner capabilities in a  variety of ways.
